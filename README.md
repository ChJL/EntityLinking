# Entity Linking
## 2020 fall Period 2 Web Data Processing System Course Assignment1 

Implement a program that receives a collection of web pages as input and returns all the entities mentioned with a link to the corresponding entity in Wikidata. Essentially, this task is to implement a entity linker.

### HTML to Text
* Use **warcio** to read warc file
* Use **BeautifulSoup** to retrieve Text from Html

### NLP Process
* Use **sent_tokenize** & **word_tokenize** from **NLTK**
* (Stemming and lemmatization may affect the results of POS tagging, so I currently skip this step)
* Stop words removal
* POS tagging
* Named Entity Recognition: derive entities using **ne_chunk** in **NLTK**

### Candidate Generation
* Use **Elastic search** to get 10 potential candidates

### Candidate Ranking
* Compare the similarity between entity mention and entity candidates using **Jaccard Similarity**. 
* After deriving 10 candates' score of similarity, we will pick the one with highest similarity. However, we set a threshold for the score. If the score of the candidate less than the threshold, we will drop the candidate.
* Finally, we obtain the entity which is highest similar to entity mention, and with its score higher than the threshold we set.

## Result

|__Gold__|500|
|:--:|:--:|
|__Predicted__|1123|
|__Correct__|40|
|__Precision__|0.0356|
|__Recall__|0.08|
|__F1__|0.0493|

### Future work
There are lots of work could be improved in our implementation. Also, our result is not good enough. First, the sentence tokenizer isn't work well because the puctuation was already removed. It's a mistake. Second, the NER package in NLTK isn't the best one for NER task. Third, the SPARQL should be used for entity candidtate ranking, so that the F1 score would be enhanced.
