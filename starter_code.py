    # Problem 1: The webpage is typically encoded in HTML format.
    # We should get rid of the HTML tags and retrieve the text. How can we do it?

    # Problem 2: Let's assume that we found a way to retrieve the text from a webpage. How can we recognize the
    # entities in the text?

    # Problem 3: We now have to disambiguate the entities in the text. For instance, let's assugme that we identified
    # the entity "Michael Jordan". Which entity in Wikidata is the one that is referred to in the text?

    # To tackle this problem, you have access to two tools that can be useful. The first is a SPARQL engine (Trident)
    # with a local copy of Wikidata. The file "test_sparql.py" shows how you can execute SPARQL queries to retrieve
    # valuable knowledge. Please be aware that a SPARQL engine is not the best tool in case you want to lookup for
    # some strings. For this task, you can use elasticsearch, which is also installed in the docker image.
    # The file start_elasticsearch_server.sh will start the elasticsearch server while the file
    # test_elasticsearch_server.py shows how you can query the engine.

    # A simple implementation would be to first query elasticsearch to retrieve all the entities with a label
    # that is similar to the text found in the web page. Then, you can access the SPARQL engine to retrieve valuable
    # knowledge that can help you to disambiguate the entity. For instance, if you know that the webpage refers to persons
    # then you can query the knowledge base to filter out all the entities that are not persons...

    # Obviously, more sophisticated implementations that the one suggested above are more than welcome :-)


    # For now, we are cheating. We are going to returthe labels that we stored in sample-labels-cheat.txt
    # Instead of doing that, you should process the text to identify the entities. Your implementation should return
    # the discovered disambiguated entities with the same format so that I can check the performance of your program.
